# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project

This repository contains the run_analysis.R script which does the following.

- Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
- Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
- Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
- Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
- From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each     subject.

Please open the script on R studio and run it. More detailed explanatory comments can be found inside the script in order to facilitate its use and understandability.
